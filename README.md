# EcoleDirecte MCP Server

Remote HTTP [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server with OAuth for [EcoleDirecte](https://www.ecoledirecte.com) — the French platform used by students, families, and teachers for homework, messaging, calendars, and more.

## Features (v0.1)

- **Direct login** — authenticates via the EcoleDirecte private API with the GTK bootstrap + credential POST flow.
- **TOTP 2FA** — handles the two-factor continuation when the account requires it.
- **Secure identity question** — handles the non-TOTP double-auth flow that asks the user to answer a verification question, then replays the login with the returned challenge proof.
- **Session import** — import an existing session from a browser-export JSON file, validated against the live API.
- **Session validation** — imported and restored sessions are probed through `rdt/sondages.awp` before being treated as authenticated; stale sessions are automatically cleared and fall back to saved credentials when available.
- **Named auth profiles** — manage separate credential sets (e.g. `parent` and `teacher`) under `~/.ecoledirecte/profiles/<name>/`. All auth tools accept an optional `profile` parameter to switch contexts.
- **Multi-family context switching** — when a session includes browser account metadata, data tools automatically renew the live token context with `renewtoken.awp` before requesting another family account.
- **Family messagerie** — lists family-level messages through the authenticated `familles/{id}/messages.awp` route.
- **Family message detail** — opens a selected family message read-only, decodes its content, and mirrors the web UI behavior that may mark it as read.
- **Student messagerie** — lists student-level messages through the authenticated `eleves/{id}/messages.awp` route.
- **Student notes** — returns period summaries and grade rows through the authenticated `eleves/{id}/notes.awp` route.

- **Teacher student carnet de correspondance** — returns the student modal data preloaded by the teacher carnet screen: profile, correspondence history, school-life data, and RDV sessions.
- **Teacher attendance targets** — lists teacher attendance classes, groups, and suggested time slots by combining account metadata with the attendance grid exposed by `niveauxListe.awp`.
- **Teacher attendance roster** — returns the attendance roster for a selected class or group and time window through the authenticated `classes/{entityId}/eleves.awp` or `groupes/{entityId}/eleves.awp` route, including per-student stage, dispense, prior-absence, and device flags.
- **Teacher cahier de textes** — returns teacher session slots for a date range through the authenticated `cahierdetexte/loadslots/{dateDebut}/{dateFin}.awp` route, including inline homework and lesson-content details.

- **Teacher council targets** — lists the principal-professor classes and available council periods exposed by `ConseilDeClasse`, derived from the authenticated `niveauxListe.awp` route.
- **Teacher council detail** — returns council student rows, mention options, class appreciation settings, and both principal-professor and teacher predefined appreciation templates through the authenticated `enseignants/{id}/{typeEntity}/{entityId}/periodes/{periodCode}/conseilDeClasse.awp`, `Prof Principal/{id}/{typeEntity}/{entityId}/appreciationsPredefinies.awp`, and `Enseignant/{id}/{typeEntity}/{entityId}/appreciationsPredefinies.awp` routes.
- **Credential & session persistence** — saves auth material locally under `~/.ecoledirecte/` with strict file permissions (0600/0700). The credentials file path can be customized via `ECOLEDIRECTE_CREDENTIALS_FILE`.
- **Structured logging** — all sensitive data (passwords, tokens, cookies) is automatically redacted from log output.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run lint
npm test
npm start
```

### Railway and Claude

Use the existing Railway project. The build command is `npm run build` and the
start command is `npm start`. Keep development dependencies available during the
build so TypeScript and Express types are installed. The HTTP server listens on
Railway's injected `PORT`; `/` is the health endpoint and `/mcp` is the MCP endpoint.

Set `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` to the deployed HTTPS base URL and supply
`MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` securely in Railway variables. Connect Claude to the `/mcp`
URL and complete OAuth. OAuth clients and tokens are held in memory, so a restart
can require reconnecting Claude.

Mount the persistent auth volume at `/data` and set `ECOLEDIRECTE_AUTH_DIR=/data`.
Supply `ECOLEDIRECTE_USERNAME` and `ECOLEDIRECTE_PASSWORD` securely; optional
`ECOLEDIRECTE_FA_CN` and `ECOLEDIRECTE_FA_CV` provide a remembered factor. Startup
synchronizes them to the auth store without trimming the password, then restores
or validates a stored session, falling back to login when needed.

Login POSTs retain cookies, matching the browser auth service's explicit
`withCredentials: true` setting. X-GTK is URL-decoded from the GTK cookie,
matching Angular's XSRF extractor; the cookie jar keeps the original value. A 505 with remembered
factors triggers one existing fallback without them; a single startup can thus
send two login POSTs. Avoid repeated restarts or login calls after a rejection.
Local protocol tests use synthetic data and do not establish successful live
EcoleDirecte authentication from Railway. Never share credential or token values
when diagnosing a deployment; use HTTP status, API code and presence flags.

### Credentials file

The `login` tool reads credentials from a JSON file instead of accepting them as arguments.

1. **Default location:** `~/.ecoledirecte/credentials.json`
2. **Custom location:** set the `ECOLEDIRECTE_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable to the absolute path of your credentials file.

Create the file with this structure:

```json
{
  "identifiant": "your-username",
  "motdepasse": "your-password",
  "fa": [
    {
      "cn": "optional-replay-cn",
      "cv": "optional-replay-cv",
      "uniq": false
    }
  ]
}
```

`fa` is optional. The server now writes reusable secure-question replay data back into this file automatically after a successful secure-question login so later `login` calls can skip repeating that challenge when EcoleDirecte still accepts the saved factor.

Keep the file permissions restrictive:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ecoledirecte/credentials.json
```

To use a custom path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ecoledirecte": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/EcoleDirecteMCP",
      "env": {
        "ECOLEDIRECTE_CREDENTIALS_FILE": "/secure/path/credentials.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Named profiles

When you need separate credentials for different account types (e.g. a parent account and a teacher account), use the `profile` parameter on auth tools:

```
login { "profile": "parent" }    → uses ~/.ecoledirecte/profiles/parent/credentials.json
login { "profile": "teacher" }   → uses ~/.ecoledirecte/profiles/teacher/credentials.json
```

Each profile stores its own `credentials.json` and `session.json` under `~/.ecoledirecte/profiles/<name>/`. The active profile is tracked in `~/.ecoledirecte/profiles.json`.

Create profile credentials:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ecoledirecte/profiles/teacher
cat > ~/.ecoledirecte/profiles/teacher/credentials.json <<'EOF'
{
  "identifiant": "teacher-username",
  "motdepasse": "teacher-password"
}
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.ecoledirecte/profiles/teacher/credentials.json
```

When no profile is specified, tools use the legacy default paths (`~/.ecoledirecte/credentials.json` and `session.json`).

If multiple family accounts or students are available, pass `accountId` and/or `studentId`. When the imported or authenticated session includes browser account metadata such as `idLogin` and `current`, the server automatically switches to the requested family context before calling the private API. The tool error payload lists the available choices when selection is ambiguous.

Student-scoped tools accept an optional `students` array of `{studentId, accountId?}` targets. When omitted, the tool queries all known students sequentially, switching account context and renewing the token between each call. All tool calls are serialized to prevent concurrent API requests from causing stale-token conflicts.

Teacher tools use the `apip.ecoledirecte.com` host observed in live browser traffic, rather than the standard `api.ecoledirecte.com` used by family/student routes.

## Browser Session Export Format

To import an existing browser session, create a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "token": "<X-Token value from authenticated requests>",
  "twoFaToken": "<2FA-Token value from authenticated requests>",
  "cookies": {
    "GTK": "<GTK cookie value>",
    "...": "other cookies"
  },
  "xGtk": "<X-GTK header value>",
  "accounts": [
    {
      "id": 828,
      "type": "1",
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "establishment": "My School",
      "idLogin": 4229759,
      "main": true,
      "current": true,
      "students": [
        {
          "id": 1154,
          "name": "Antonin Doe",
          "classId": 18,
          "className": "3B",
          "classCode": "3B",
          "establishment": "My School"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "version": "4.96.3"
}
```

For multi-family accounts, prefer a browser-style export that preserves each account's `idLogin` and `current` fields so the server can reproduce the live `renewtoken.awp` account switch. Then use the `import_session` tool with the file path.

## Auth Flow (Reverse-Engineered)

1. **Bootstrap GET** → `https://api.ecoledirecte.com/v3/login.awp?gtk=1&v=4.96.3`
   - Obtains GTK cookie and header values needed for authentication.

2. **Login POST** → `https://api.ecoledirecte.com/v3/login.awp?v=4.96.3`
   - Content-Type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
   - Body: `data=<url-encoded JSON>` with `{identifiant, motdepasse, isReLogin, uuid, fa}`
   - Headers: `X-GTK` from bootstrap, cookies from bootstrap.

3. **Response handling:**
   - Code `200` → authenticated, token in response.
  - Code `250` with `data.totp=true` → TOTP required.
  - Code `250` with `data.totp=false` → secure question required; fetch the question with `POST /v3/connexion/doubleauth.awp?verbe=get&v=4.96.3`, submit the chosen answer to `...verbe=post`, then replay `login.awp` with the returned `cn`/`cv` values inside the `fa` array. On success the reusable `fa` value is persisted back to `credentials.json` for future logins.
   - Code `505` → invalid credentials.
   - Code `516`/`535` → account blocked.
   - Code `521` → session/token expired.

4. **Session validation (probe):**
  - Imported and restored sessions are probed with `POST /v3/rdt/sondages.awp?verbe=get&v=4.96.3` and `data={}`.
   - If the probe returns code `200`, the session is promoted to authenticated.
   - If the probe returns code `521` (expired), the persisted session is cleared and the server falls back to saved credentials if available.

5. **Cross-family context switch:**
  - When a request targets another family account, the browser renews the session with `POST /v3/renewtoken.awp?verbe=post&v=4.96.3` and `data={"idUser":<account.idLogin>,"uuid":""}`.
  - The response rotates `X-Token`, `2FA-Token`, and cookies, and the server persists that updated authenticated context before retrying the data route.

## Data Routes (Reverse-Engineered)
